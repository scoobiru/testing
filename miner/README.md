# miner test binaries
This part of the repo holds various test builds of the miner. Each should be treated as experimental and may contain various bugs or side-effects of new features in test.

Windows binaries and CL files pulled from Discord posts are named with date/time of post. CL files can be used with either of their corresponding Windows or Linux binary. CL files should be renamed to the default 'dyn_miner2.cl' prior to use of the binary.

Windows binaries may be used as named or renamed to preference. Linux binaries are compiled with the default name as of the last dated CL. Dated Linux binaries not provided at this time.
